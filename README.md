Dribbble Responses
==================

A Google Chrome extension that hides short, useless comments on Dribbble shots.

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/andrejewski/dribbble-responses/blob/master/dr-chrome.crx?raw=true)

## Installation

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Drag dr-chrome.crx into the page that appears.
Open and refresh any page for the changes to reflect.

## Customization

Dribbble Responses allows you customize what is considered "useless." In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions, navigate to Dribble Responses and select "Options" which should lead to something like this:

![Dribble Responses Settings](https://github.com/andrejewski/dribbble-responses/blob/master/dr-chrome/dribbble-response-settings.png?raw=true)

You may change the length threshold for comments to be relevant, which means if the comment's length does not exceed the threshold it will not be displayed. 

You can also supply your Dribbble username which will uncensored all comments on your own shots so you don't miss anything.

If you want to see all of the comments on any given shot, there is a "Show all Comments" button right next to the response count on the shot's comment section.

## Inspiration

I was reading Designer News and saw this [evil nightmare](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dribbble-random-comments/hiafieffmjgfdkkangdicdiolccjelkf)'s [thread](https://news.layervault.com/stories/27202-dribbble-comments--chrome-extension) and I completely agreed with [Daryl Ginn](https://news.layervault.com/u/154/daryl-ginn) and was equally let down. So I sat down to solve our problem. 

Now only the quality comments are spared the wrath of oblivion and I can see useful feedback without mulling through garbage. (It is surprising how comment quality correlates to comment length so well.)

## People who use this also like...

I made some other programs that fit within this space of interest. 

[**txt2text**](https://github.com/andrejewski/txt2text) is a Chrome extension that replaces a customizable list of acronyms with their expanded forms.

[**Color Me Shocked**](http://chrisandrejewski.com/project/color-me-shocked/) is a real-time color conversion tool that you have to try to believe.

[**Reem**](https://github.com/andrejewski/reem) is a static site generator written in JavaScript that is better than every other generator out there I promise. 

## Fin

Thanks for using Dribbble Responses. Or for at least reading this far down into the README.
